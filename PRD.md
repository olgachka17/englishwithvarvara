## Design Direction
The design should feel like a burst of sunshine - vibrant, optimistic, and full of energy. Think bold colors, playful typography, and dynamic shapes that convey movement and growth. The aesthetic should be modern and Instagram-ready while maintaining professionalism. Emojis and personality shine through, making English learning feel less like work and more like an exciting journey with a friend.

## Color Selection
A bold, energetic palette inspired by tropical vibes and positive energy:

- **Primary Color**: oklch(0.75 0.20 35) - Vibrant coral/orange-pink that radiates warmth and energy, communicates enthusiasm and approachability
- **Secondary Colors**:

## Animations
Animations should feel playful and energetic without being distracting - like gentle bounces and smooth slides that guide attention and celebrate interactions. Use entrance animations for sections as they scroll into view (gentle fade-up), subtle hover effects on cards (slight lift and glow), and satisfying button interactions (scale + color shift). The overall feel should be lively but professional, with spring-based physics for natural movement.
