## Design Direction
The design should feel like a burst of sunshine - vibrant, optimistic, and full of energy. Think bold colors, playful typography, and dynamic shapes that convey movement and growth.

Emojis and personality shine through, making English learning feel less like work and more like an exciting journey with a friend.
